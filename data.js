// SUBSCRIPTION_CATALOG: a hand-curated, hand-researched snapshot (July 2026).
// Not a live feed — see CLAUDE.md. Not every company has full history —
// some only have a single current-reference price point (oldPrice: null)
// where no confirmed past change could be sourced, and a few have none at
// all. Never invent numbers; "no data" is shown honestly in the UI.
//
// Each company entry:
//   domain: the company's real web domain — used to fetch a small logo/
//     favicon at render time (see CLAUDE.md for why that's an external
//     dependency, not a hosted asset).
//   subscribers (optional): { count, asOf, note, source } — only present
//     when a real figure has been publicly disclosed (mostly large public
//     companies via earnings reports). Absent means "not publicly
//     disclosed," never a guess.
//
// priceHistory entry shape:
//   date: "YYYY-MM-DD" (approximate where noted)
//   planLabel: which plan/tier this applies to
//   oldPrice / newPrice: monthly-equivalent numbers in `currency`; oldPrice
//     is null when this is just a current-reference price point or a
//     new-plan launch, not a confirmed change from a prior price. For
//     plans only ever sold annually (no monthly option), these are a
//     derived monthly-equivalent (annual / 12) — the note says so.
//   annualPrice (optional): the real published annual price for this plan
//     at newPrice, when one exists — not just newPrice × 12. Shown inline
//     alongside the monthly price. Absent means "no confirmed real annual
//     price" — the UI falls back to an explicitly-labeled ×12 estimate.
//   note: short human-readable context
//   source: a real URL to where this was reported
//
// forecast (optional, only present when something is publicly known):
//   { date: "YYYY-MM-DD" | null, note: string, source: url }
//   date is null when timing was announced only vaguely. No company here
//   has a confirmed *specific future date* as of this research pass —
//   companies rarely pre-announce hikes far ahead — so this field is
//   mostly absent, and the UI shows "Unknown" for those.
