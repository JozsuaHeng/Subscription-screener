## What this is

**SubScreener** — a subscription price board, styled a bit like a stock/crypto
screener (think CoinMarketCap), for subscription companies instead of
coins. Full-width, sortable table of ~72 well-known subscription
companies (streaming, music, software, gaming, fitness, etc), each row
showing:

- **Price** — every tracked plan/tier for that company (e.g. Netflix
  shows Standard-with-ads, Standard, and Premium as three lines, Peacock
  shows Select / Premium / Premium Plus), not just one "headline" number
  — ad-supported and ad-free tiers are both included wherever a streaming
  service has both. Each tier shows its monthly price and its annual
  price together, inline — a real published annual price when one is
  known, otherwise a clearly-tagged "est." (monthly × 12). No toggle to
  click; both units are just always visible. Prices are USD only — real
  prices vary by country, and getting that right for every plan here was
  deliberately cut from this MVP rather than shipping a misleadingly-
  precise currency conversion.
- **Change % / Price Movement / Changed** — the most recent sourced price
  change (for the row's "headline" plan — see below), split into three
  columns instead of one crowded cell: the percentage, the actual dollar
  move (e.g. "$15.49 → $17.99"), and how long ago it was.
- **Since Tracked** — cumulative % change from whatever the *earliest*
  tracked price point actually is, to today. This replaced a rigid "1Y /
  2Y / 3Y ago" trio that was empty for most companies whenever research
  didn't happen to reach exactly that far back — this is fillable for
  any company with 2+ tracked price points instead.
- **Hike Frequency** — how often this company touches pricing at all
  (e.g. "~every 12mo, 5 hikes tracked"), across every plan, not tied to
  any fixed lookback window.
- **vs Category Avg** — how this company's current price compares to the
  average current price across its whole category (e.g. "+18% vs
  Streaming avg"). Computed purely from current prices, so it works for
  all companies regardless of how much price-change history exists —
  the one column that's never gated by research depth.
- **Forecast** — either a **Confirmed** publicly-announced future price
  change (from `company.forecast`, sourced), or — when nothing official
  exists — a clearly-labeled **Estimated** guess based on how often that
  company has historically touched pricing (e.g. "~Mar 2027, based on 3
  tracked changes, roughly every 15 months"). The estimate is a pattern
  extrapolation, never a claim about a real announcement — it's styled
  and worded differently from a confirmed one so the two are never
  confused. "Unknown" only appears when there's too little history (0-1
  tracked changes) to estimate a cadence at all.
- **Subscribers** — a real disclosed subscriber/member count for the ~14
  companies (mostly large public ones) where one has been publicly
  reported, e.g. via earnings. "Not disclosed" for the rest — most
  private companies (VPNs, meditation apps, most SaaS tools) simply don't
  publish this, and that's shown honestly rather than guessed.
- **Trend** — a small sparkline: each real price point connected by a
  smooth "ease" curve (not a harsh diagonal or a jagged step), with a
  soft area wash and a small end-dot marking the current price. The
  precise numbers already live in the columns beside it, so this chart's
  only job is to be a pleasant at-a-glance shape — see the "sparkline
  redesign" note in `app.js` above `sparklineSvg()` for the reasoning.
  Hovering any point on the line shows its real date and price (a native
  SVG `<title>` on an invisible hit-circle — no custom tooltip JS).

Each row's logo is fetched live from the company's own domain via a
public favicon service (`logoUrl()` in `app.js`) — not a hosted image
asset. If it fails to load, it's removed and the colored-initial avatar
underneath shows through automatically.

The **#** and **Company** columns are frozen (`position: sticky`) so
they stay in view while you scroll horizontally through the rest of the
(wide) table — you never lose track of which row you're looking at. The
column **header row** is also frozen while scrolling vertically. This
took two attempts: the first (`top: 71px` on the `<th>`s, relying on the
whole page to scroll) hit a real browser bug — `position: sticky` on a
table cell whose scrolling ancestor is *ambiguous* (an element with
`overflow-x: auto` but no explicit `overflow-y`/height) can collapse
that row's height to 0 while still painting its content, overlapping
row 1 instead of sitting above it. The fix was to make `.table-scroll`
a deliberate, bounded scroll container (`max-height: 70vh; overflow-y:
auto`) rather than an implicit one — confirmed by screenshot-testing
several other candidate fixes (border-collapse, sticky-on-`<tr>` instead
of `<th>`, disabling the frozen columns) that did *not* work before
landing on this one. `top: 0` now means "top of the table's own
scrollport," not the page.

A **"🔥 Changed in last 90 days"** button next to the search box quick-
filters the board down to companies with a tracked change inside that
window — a fast way to check "what's actually moved lately" without
sorting the whole table.

Above the table, a **highlights strip** surfaces a few "headlines" from
the whole catalog regardless of the current filter/search — the biggest
recent hike, a rare price drop (if one exists), and whichever company
hikes prices most often. Clicking one filters the board down to that
company. The topbar also shows a **"Data as of"** badge, computed from
the newest date anywhere in `data.js` — it updates itself whenever the
dataset does, nothing to keep in sync by hand.

Below ~1000px wide, the table is replaced by a **stacked-card layout**
(same data, same cell-rendering functions, just a different container) —
a 1440px-wide table doesn't work on a phone, and horizontal-scrolling a
table like that on a small screen is unpleasant. Both layouts are built
from the same computed data every render and a CSS breakpoint decides
which one is visible; see `buildTableRow()` / `buildCard()` in `app.js`.

Click any row (or card) to expand its full sourced price-change history for every
tracked plan (not just the row's "headline" one), plus a summary line
(tracked-since date, cumulative % change, and how many price-change
events have been recorded across all of that company's plans).

There is no personal subscription tracking / "add your own subscription"
feature — that was deliberately removed. This app is purely a public
reference board.

## How it's built (and why)

Plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no build step. Just open `index.html`.

This is a standalone project with its own git history, living at the top
level of the `JozsuaHeng` shelf (not nested inside `ai-slop/`) — it
started there as a quick experiment, then graduated to a serious,
standalone project once it grew past that scope.

- `data.js` — `SUBSCRIPTION_CATALOG`: the hand-curated, hand-researched
  dataset. See the comment at the top of the file for the exact entry
  shape (including the optional `forecast` and `subscribers` fields, and
  the required `domain` field used for logos). **This is a point-in-time
  snapshot, not a live feed** — nothing in this app scrapes the internet
  or calls any API for price data. The one live network call is the logo
  fetch (see below) — display only, never data.
- `storage.js` — tiny `localStorage` wrapper for exactly one UI
  preference: theme (light/dark). That's the only thing this app ever
  persists.
- `app.js` — all logic:
  - `allTierPrices()` lists every tracked plan's current price for the
    Price column. `representativeHistory()` separately picks one
    "headline" plan (the one with the most tracked entries; ties broken
    by highest current price) to drive the Last Change / Since Tracked /
    Trend columns — click the row to see every plan's own history.
  - `companyStats()`'s `sinceTrackedPct` is cumulative change from the
    earliest tracked price point to now — deliberately not tied to a
    fixed 1/2/3-year lookback.
  - `hikeDates()` / `avgIntervalMonths()` / `hikeCadenceInfo()` drive the
    Hike Frequency column and `estimatedForecast()`'s cadence-based guess
    — both computed across *all* of a company's plans, not just the
    headline one (a broader "how often does this company touch pricing"
    signal, not a per-plan prediction).
  - `categoryAverages()` / `categoryAvgPct()` drive "vs Category Avg" —
    averaged across the whole catalog (not the current filter/search) so
    the comparison stays stable while browsing.
  - `logoUrl()` fetches a small favicon by domain from a public favicon
    service at render time — the one external network dependency in this
    app (display only; see "Why there's no live scraping" below for why
    that's a deliberate, narrow exception). `onerror="this.remove()"` on
    the `<img>` is the entire fallback mechanism — no JS state to track.
  - `computeHighlights()` / `renderHighlights()` drive the highlights
    strip; `latestDataDate()` drives the "Data as of" badge.
  - `buildTableRow()` and `buildCard()` both consume the same per-company
    entry (and the same cell-renderer functions above) to build the
    desktop `<tr>` and the mobile card — kept in sync by construction
    rather than by two independently-maintained templates.
  - `sparklinePointData()` pairs each price with a hover label (date +
    formatted price); `sparklineSvg()` draws an invisible, `<title>`-
    bearing hit-circle over every point for the hover tooltip.
  - Sortable column headers (click to sort by Price / Change % / Since
    Tracked / Hike Frequency / vs Category Avg / Company name), category
    filter chips, search, a "changed in last 90 days" quick filter
    (`recentOnly` / `RECENT_WINDOW_DAYS`), and a light/dark theme toggle.
    No currency conversion — see the Price bullet above for why.
- `style.css` — full-width table layout; dark theme is the base `:root`,
  light theme overrides live under `:root[data-theme="light"]`.

## Why there's no live scraping / real-time data

An always-on system that actually re-checks 50-100 companies' pricing
pages needs a hosted server, a database, and a scheduled job — and
scrapers break constantly when vendor sites change their markup, plus
some sites' terms of service don't allow it. That's a different, much
bigger project than anything else on this shelf.

(The one exception is the company logos, which load live from a public
favicon service by domain — display polish, not data. If that ever feels
like the wrong tradeoff, the fallback is already there: remove the
`<img>` and every row's colored-initial avatar carries on unchanged.)

Instead, the dataset is refreshed **on request**: when asked to "update
the price tracker" (or similar), research current price-change news (and
any newly-requested companies) and edit `data.js` — always with a real
source URL, never invented numbers, and never inventing a specific
forecast date that wasn't actually reported. There is no automatic/
scheduled refresh; this was a deliberate choice over a cron-scheduled
agent or a real scraper backend, both heavier, ongoing-maintenance
commitments.

## Refreshing / extending the dataset later

To add companies, newer price changes, a newly-announced forecast, a real
annual price (`annualPrice` field — only set it from an actually-
published annual plan, never a guess), or a disclosed subscriber count
(`subscribers` field — only from a real, sourced figure; omit rather than
estimate): research it (get a real source URL), then add/edit an entry in
`SUBSCRIPTION_CATALOG` in `data.js`. A new company entry needs a `domain`
too (for its logo). No other file needs to change. If a plan's official
name is ambiguous, verify it rather than guessing — e.g. Disney+'s ad
tier is officially "Disney+ Basic", not just "with ads".

72 of a ~75-company target are in `data.js`. The last few weren't added
on purpose: research ran out of confidently-sourced candidates rather
than being cut off arbitrarily — padding the count with unverified
numbers would violate the "never invent numbers" rule above. Two new
categories arrived in this pass too: **AI Tools** (ChatGPT Plus,
Perplexity Pro, Claude Pro — all converged on $20/mo) and **Finance**
(Robinhood Gold, YNAB).
